# Flashcard Project

## Project Abstract
- This project is a flashcards game that is played in the CLI (Command Line Interface). The user views a flashcard with a question and three possible solutions. By clicking the up or down arrows, the user can choose an answer and when hitting enter, it told if the answer was correct or not. The user can also see immediately how many flashcards are in the list. When the flashcards run out, the user is told that the round is over and recieves an overall score percentage. This project was constructed by Hollis Vohr, a Mod 2 student at Turing. This was my first project of the inning after a brief introduction to TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Installation Instructions
- To access this website, navigate to the [Github respository](https://github.com/hvohr/flashcards) and fork the repository. You then want to clone it down on your local machine by copying the SSH key and typing `git clone` with the SSH key after it. You then want to `cd` into the new directory labeled rockPaperScissors. Run `node index.js` in the terminal to play the game.

##  Technologies Used
- This project was written using VSCode and some pre-written code from instructors for the conversion into a CLI game. Javascript was the only language used in this project and I worked with Github to ensure I maintained proper git workflow. Test Driven Development was something that was focused on for this project, ensuring that proper unit testing was used to verify if a function was working properly.
